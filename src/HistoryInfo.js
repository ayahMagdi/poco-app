          <p className='description'>Time flies when you do what you love. We know because we’ve been making great pizza since 1967. Along the way, we’ve grown to more than 750 restaurants from coast to coast, becoming a trusted brand and leader in the foodservice industry. We’re proud of the quality food we make – and the difference we make in communities across Canada. We’ve made a lot of pies – and memories – over the years. Find out what goes into both!</p>
